Communicating Within the Ostro |trade| Project Community
##########################################################

As the Ostro Project community grows, it's important to share design
and implemention ideas with the whole community.  Whenever possible, 
sharing information should be the default and not the
exception. That means having discussions in public forums and ensuring team
and community members not present get the same information. Exceptions
are legal and human issues, which may have to be discussed more privately.

This technical note offers some communicaiton guidelines we, as a community, 
should work by.

Email and Mailing Lists
=======================

Mailing lists are a convenient way to communicate with Ostro project members as
well as other developers interested in the Ostro OS.  These lists are perhaps
the most convenient way to track developer discussions and to ask your own
support questions to the Ostro OS community.  You can find a list of
the available mailing lists, how to subscribe, and what each list is used for
from https://lists.ostroproject.org

You can also read through
the mailing list archives to follow past posts and discussions.

If you need someone specific to respond, include them explicitly in the
recipient list (because then it is more likely to be in the main inbox
of that recipient) and call out his or her name early in the email.
Group-reply to all emails because there might be participants who are
not subscribed to the mailinglist.

The mailing list automatically archives the mail
thread, so trim away old content and only keep the part that you are
replying to. Inline replies are preferred.

Documents
=========

When writing something which will need to be ratified as an official
part of the Ostro OS, create or modify a reStructuredText :file:`.rst`
file in one of the sub-folders in the meta-ostro repository :file:`doc`
folder and submit the change for review
in a pull request.  We're using the Sphinx document generation tools
for processing and creating our technical documentation web content.
You can find some helpful writing and formatting
tips in the :ref:`doc_guidelines` tech note.

Meetings
========

If a meeting is open to all interested parties, add the mailing
lists as an optional participant.

Remember to write meeting minutes and send a pointer to them via email,
copying a mailing list. If possible, include the 
minutes or at least a summary of them in that email so the recipient
can decide whether the minutes are relevant for them without having to
leave their mail reader.

Chat
====

You can chat online with the Ostro OS developer community and other users in
our IRC channel...
