Booting and Installing an Ostro |trade| OS Image
#################################################

This technical note explains the basic procedures for taking an Ostro OS image that was downloaded
or built from source (using instructions in :ref:`Building Images`), and installing and 
running that image one of the :ref:`platforms`.

Two images are of interest for this process (depending if you're using real hardware or a VM):

:file:`.dsk`
    A raw disk image in GPT format and contains at least one UEFI bootable partition
    and at least one ext4 partition (rootfs).  For details on disk layout
    see the associated :file:`.json` file in the same directory as the image file.

:file:`.vdi`
    A :file:`.dsk` image converted to VirtualBox\* format (with no other differences).


Ostro OS Images
===============

As explained in the :ref:`Building Images` tech note, there are several image variants available
depending on your need.  For simplicity and the needs of this tech note, we'll use the dev image that includes
additional build and debugging tools that wouldn't typically be included in a production device image.  This
dev image also permits root login access at the console and via SSH, something that normally would not be available
in a production device image either.

Using dd to Create Bootable Media
=================================

Once you have the :file:`.dsk` Ostro OS image you need to get it
onto your hardware platform, typically by using removable media such as a 
USB thumb drive or SD card.  The typical way to do this is with the :command:`dd` command.

   #. Connect your USB thumb drive or SD card to your Linux-based development system
      (minimum 2 GB card required). 
   #. If you're not sure about your media device name, use the :command:`dmesg` command to view the system log 
      and see which device the USB thumb drive or SD card was assigned (e.g. :file:`/dev/sdb`)::

        $ dmesg 

      or you can use the :command:`lsblk` command to show the block-level devices; a USB drive usually shows up as ``/sdb`` or ``/sdc``
      (almost never as ``/sda``)

   #. The :command:`dd` command will overwrite all content on the device so be careful specifying 
      the correct media device. In the example below, :file:`/dev/sdb` is the 
      destination USB device on our development machine::

         $ sudo umount /dev/sdb*
         $ sudo dd if=<ostro-os-image.dsk> of=/dev/sdb bs=512k
         $ sync

      Unplug the removable media from your development system and you're ready to plug 
      it into your target system.


MinnowBoard MAX
================

The `MinnowBoard MAX`_ is a small formfactor board with an Intel |reg| Atom |trade| E3825 dual-core processor (supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit images).  
Once you have the Ostro OS image on a USB thumb drive (or SD card), you can use this to boot your MinnowBoard MAX-compatible board as you would
most any Intel UEFI-based system.  The procedure will be similar for other boards so weâ€™ll use this as an example.  
See http://wiki.minnowboard.org for additional information about setting up the MinnowBoard hardware. 

It's important to use a current version of firmware on your board, so we recommend checking this 
first and updating the firmware if needed using the instructions 
at http://wiki.minnowboard.org/MinnowBoard_MAX_HW_Setup 

Here are the basic steps for booting the Ostro OS:

    #. Connect an HDMI monitor, USB keyboard, and network cable. Alternatively you can connect the serial 
       FTDI cable from the MinnowBoard to a USB port on your host computer and use a terminal emulator 
       to communicate with the MinnowBoard.)
    #. Plug in the USB thumb drive with your Ostro OS image to your MinnowBoard
    #. Power the board on.
    #. Wait for the system to enter the EFI shell where you can set the system date and time with the :command:`date` and :command:`time`
       (Because the MinnowBoard MAX does not have a battery for the clock (RTC), the system date and time revert to the date and time
       when the firmware was created.)
    #. Enter :command:`exit` to return to the boot option screen
    #. Use the arrow keys to select Boot Manager, press return, then select EFI USB Device, and press return
    #. The Ostro OS will begin booting
    #. Debug information about the boot will display, then an Ostro OS identification line, followed by a login prompt.  Login as ``root``, 
       no password is required.

Gigabyte
========

The `GigaByte GB-BXBT-3825 <http://iotsolutionsalliance.intel.com/solutions-directory/gb-bxbt-3825-iot-gateway-solution>`_
is a gateway solution powered by an Intel |reg| Atom |trade| E3825 dual-core processor 
(both 32-bit and 64-bit images are supported). Booting is similar to booting a 
MinnowBoard MAX from the USB thumbdrive described above.

Intel Edison
============

Flashing an Intel Edison requires use of a breakout board and two micro-USB cables:

    #. Install the ``dfu-util`` package. (You may also need the ``xfstk`` utility from http://xfstk.sourceforge.net 
       for recovery cases.)
    #. Plug in a micro-USB cable to the J3 connector on the board (corner next to the FTDI chip)
    #. Flip the DIP switch towards jumper J16
    #. Open :command:`minicom` or other terminal program on your host computer to attach to the serial console
    #. Download the ``flashall`` folder from the Ostro OS download folder for edison (on https://download.ostroproject.org)
    #. Copy the flashall script (``flashall.sh``) from the flashall folder to the Ostro OS image folder
    #. Then in the image folder run:: 

       $ sudo ./flashall.sh

    #. Plug in the second micro-USB cable to the J16 connector as instructed by the running flashall script
    #. Wait for all the images to flash. You will see the progress on both the flasher and on the serial console.
    #. Once flashing is done, the image will automatically boot up. Login as ``root``, no password is required.
