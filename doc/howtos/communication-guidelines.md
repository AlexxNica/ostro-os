# General Principles

Whenever possible, sharing information should be the default, not the
exceptions. That means communicating in public and ensuring that team
and community members not present get the same information. Exceptions
are legal and human issues, which may have to be discussed more privately.

# Guidelines

## Email Lists

*TODO*: describe public mailing lists

If you need someone specific to respond, include them explicitly in the
recipient list (because then it is more likely to be in the main inbox
of that recipient) and call out his or her name early in the email.
Group-reply to all emails because there might be participants who are
not subscribed to the mailinglist.

When copying a list, the mailing list automatically archives the mail
thread, so trim away old content and only keep the part that you are
replying to. Inline replies are preferred.

## Documents

When writing something which will have to be ratified as an official
part of Ostro OS, create or modify a reStructuredText file in the "doc"
folder of the meta-ostro repository and submit the change for review
in a pull request.

## Meetings

If a meeting is open to all interested parties, add one of the mailing
lists as an optional participant.

Remember to write meeting minutes and send a pointer to them via email,
copying a mailing list. If possible, include the current content of the
minutes or at least a summary in that email because then the recipient
can decide whether the minutes are relevant for them without having to
leave their mail reader.

## Chat

*TODO*: document chat channel
