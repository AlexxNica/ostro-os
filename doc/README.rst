The doc directory contains information about Ostro OS.

The intention is to keep these documents up-to-date with the code and
release them together.

Documentation changes go through the same review process as code.

The preferred format is reStructuredText_, with .rst as file
ending. Some older documents still use GitHub Markdown (.md).
