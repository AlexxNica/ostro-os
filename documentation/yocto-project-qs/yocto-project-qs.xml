        Welcome to the Yocto Project!  
        The Yocto Project is an open-source Linux development environment.  
        This short document will give you some basic information about the environment as well as let you experience it in its simplest form.  
        After reading this document you will have a basic understanding of what the Yocto Project is and how to work within it.  
        This document also steps you through a simple example showing you how to build a small image and run it using the QEMU emulator.
    </para>
    <para>
        For complete information on the Yocto Project you should check out the <ulink url='http://www.yoctolinux.org'>Public Yocto Website</ulink>.
        You can find the latest builds, breaking news, full development documentation, and a rich Yocto Project Development Community into which you can tap.

    <title>Introducing the Yocto Project Development Environment</title>

    <para>
        Yocto Project is an open source development environment that creates Linux-based images suitable for many types of devices (large or small) based on architectures such as x86, x86-64, Xeon, ARM, and MIPS as well as PowerPC and device emulation.
        You can use Yocto Project to design, develop, build, debug, simulate, and test the complete software stack using Linux, the X Window System, GNOME Mobile-based application frameworks, and Qt frameworks.

            <para>Makes available system components such as X11, Matchbox, GTK+, Pimlico, Clutter, and Qt (among others) so you can create a richer user interface experience on devices that use displays or have a GUI.

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
        Yocto Project generates file system images based on open source software such as the Kdrive X server, the Matchbox Window Manager, the GTK+ Toolkit and the D-Bus Message Bus System.  
        Yocto Project can generate images for many kinds of devices.  
        However, the standard example machines target QEMU full system emulation for x86, ARM, MIPS, and PPC based architectures as well as specific hardware such as the Intel Desktop Board DH55TC.  
        Because an image developed with Yocto Project can boot inside a QEMU emulator, the development environment works nicely as a test platform for developing embedded software.
    </para>

    <para>
        Another important Yocto Project feature is the Sato component.  
        The optional Sato component, a GNOME mobile-based user interface environment well suited for devices with restricted screen sizes, sits neatly on top of any device using the GNOME Mobile Stack providing a well defined user experience.

        Now that you have your system requirements in order you can give Yocto Project a try.  
        This section presents some steps that let you do the following:

    <section id='building-image'>
        <title>Building an Image</title>
 
        <para>
            In the development environment you will need to build an image whenever you change hardware support, add or change system libraries, or add or change services that have dependencies.

         <para>
             Use the following commands from a shell on your Debian-based host to build your image.  
             The build creates an entire Linux system including the Toolchain from the source.
         </para>

         <para><emphasis>NOTE:</emphasis>  The build process using Sato currently consumes 50GB of disk space.
             To allow for vbariations in the build process and for future package expansion we recommend 100GB of free disk space.

            If hardware, libraries and services are stable you can use a pre-built image of the kernel and just run it on the target using the emulator QEMU.  
            This situation is perfect for developing application software.
