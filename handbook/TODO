Handbook Todo List:

  * Add instructions about using zaurus/openmoko emulation
  * Add diagrams + oprofile screenshot
  * Software Deevelopment intro should mention its software development for 
    intended target and could be a different arch etc and thus special case. 

Long Term:

  * Document remaining classes (see list in ref-classes)
