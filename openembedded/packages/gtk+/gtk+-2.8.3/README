disable-tooltips.patch

  Makes sense for toucscreens at least. Could be made better by being
  an XSettings property: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=315112

hardcoded_libtool.patch

  Fix libtool calls in configure - likely needed although should go upstream in
  some form if possible.


Probably Uneeded
===

no-xwc.patch
 
  Removes any (uneeded) i18n xlib calls that are just stubs in an xlib built
  with --disable-locale.  Might not be needed as Xlib should provide stubs.

gtklabel-resize-patch

  Forces a resize when the style is set. Shouldn't be needed as the
  clear_layout() call should do what is required.  Remove and see?

no-demos.patch
 
  Do we want demos to be built?  RB: does it matter if they are built, can we
  just not install gtk-demo?

scroll-timings.patch

  Slows down the delays when clicking on scrollbars.

single-click.patch

  Makes the (deprecated) GtkFileSelector use single-click rather than double.

gtk+-handhelds.patch 

  Crack insane patch which changes the size of arrows, fiddles how the calendar
  works, adds a min-width style property on GtkEntry, and adds support for the
  RECOGNISE_PROTOCOLS atom.


Not Sure
===

Not sure what this appears to do or how they affect things too be useful;

 menu-deactivate.patch
 spinbutton.patch

 automake-lossage.patch


Can Definitely Go
===

small-gtkfilesel.patch - CRACK! 
xsettings.patch        - EVEEL!
