# Version 4 of the Berkeley DB from Sleepycat
#
# At present this package only installs the DB code
# itself (shared libraries, .a in the dev package),
# documentation and headers.
#
# The headers have the same names as those as v3
# of the DB, only one version can be used *for dev*
# at once - DB3 and DB4 can both be installed on the
# same system at the same time if really necessary.
