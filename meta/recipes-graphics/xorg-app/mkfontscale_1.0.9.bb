SUMMARY = "A program to create an index of scalable font files for X"

DESCRIPTION = "For each directory argument, mkfontscale reads all of the \
scalable font files in the directory. For every font file found, an X11 \
font name (XLFD) is generated, and is written together with the file \
name to a file fonts.scale in the directory.  The resulting fonts.scale \
is used by the mkfontdir program."
