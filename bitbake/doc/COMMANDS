oebuild.sh has several commands. Some of them call functions in
bin/build/oebuild.sh (or in one of the oeclasses, if the *.oe build file
contains the "inherited ..." keyword).

Here is a list of what command calls what shell function.

The column "cd'd to this dir" specifies to which directory you have been
cd'd into before the function get's called.
