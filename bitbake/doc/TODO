TODO:

[x] Update .oe and .conf parsers to not strip out all the tabs in our 
    python function vars..
[x] Update patcher tool to make use of our ability to use python functions.
[.] Write package.oeclass implemented w/ a python function/task
[ ] Write ipkg.oeclass which inherits package.oeclass to produce an ipk from
    our metadata.

[ ] Once we have that per package deployment code, write a staging oeclass
    that lets you use the FILES blocks for our deployment packages to do the
    installs into the appropriate staging areas, to save time writing do_stage
    functions.
[ ] Finish up extensibility bits for the core oe code, and merge some of the
    class implementations into something sane.

[ ] Assuming cworth has the base ipkg libs rearchitected, start work on oemake.
    If he hasnt, start rearchitecting ipkg.
