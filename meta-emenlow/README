To use this layer, you will need to add ${OEROOT}/meta-emenlow to the
BBLAYERS variable in build/conf/bblayers.conf, like this:

	BBLAYERS = " \
	  ${OEROOT}/meta-emenlow \ 
	  ${OEROOT}/meta \
	  "

Also, per the comment, increment LCONF_VERSION in
build/conf/bblayers.conf and build/conf/bblayers.conf.sample, and
LAYER_CONF_VERSION in meta/conf/sanity.conf so that they all match.

In conf/local.conf, set MACHINE to "emenlow".

Then build the image of your choice (this was tested with sato), copy
it to your device, and boot it.
